# Convolutional Neural Network
Deep learning to identify dog or cat in the given image.

Process :- 

1] Data Preprocessing.

2] Image Agumentation for train as well as test set.

3] Convolutional Neural Nework Initialising.

4] Adding convolutional layer

5] Pooling

5] Adding second convolutioanl layer

6] Flatenning

7] Connections by specifying number of neurons

8] Adding Output layer with Sigmoid Activation function

9] Compiling the CNN

10] Training on train data and evaluating on test data

11] Making the Prediction.
